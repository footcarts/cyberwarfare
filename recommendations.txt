* Planets generate resources
* Ports trade resources
* Ships make a profit by buying at low prices and selling at higher

I recommend something like this:

* Create a planet class with a command that generates resources
* Create a port class that
 - orbits a specific planet
 - can check inventory levels of the planet; maybe the port has its own inventory but I’m mostly thinking it’s just a way of 
 selling stuff from/to the planet
 - decides a price (can be fixed for now) for goods available from the planet
 - can offer goods at that price to docked ships

There are a lot of details left out. You haven’t implemented ships yet, does that need to be first? 
Or can our floating god-like super user just do what a ship does for now? What will the payment be? Generic credits?
Do those have to be stored on the ship? Is it just a counter or an actual item in storage?
